# SummerResearch
Summer research work under Professor Giuseppe Carleo's supervision.<br>
Use neural network quantum state to study the ground state of 1d spin chain that has translationally invariant random nearest neighbour interation. <br>
The code uses [NetKet](https://www.netket.org/index.html) package. <br>
<br>
There're some self-defined models in models.py. <br>
There're some auxiliary classes in auxiliar.py <br>
error-vs-corrlen.py is used to generate data for error-correlation length plot. <br>
error-vs-corrlen.ipynb can be used to do tests more conveniently. <br>
